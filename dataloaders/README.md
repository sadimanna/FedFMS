Use it directly, without preprocessing or division. Put the subfolders from the two separately compressed zip archives into the same directory. (i.e. Nuclei_1024 folder puts 'PanNuke2Adrenal_gland', 'PanNuke2Esophagus', 'PanNuke3Bile-duct', 'PanNuke3Uterus', 'MoNuSAC2020', 'TNBC', ' MoNuSAC2018' seven folders)
